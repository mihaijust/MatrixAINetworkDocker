### System Requirements

| OS        | Windows, Linux                               |   |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|---|
| CPU       | 8 Core (Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU X5670 @2.93GHz) |   |
| RAM       | 16G                                          |   |
| Free HD   | 300G                                         |   |
| Bandwidth | 20M                                          |   |
|           |                                              |   |

The idea here is that if you have the extra tokens to stake, you can create multiple containers. Since they will not all get picked at once, you increase your odds of utilizing your hardware if you have multiple containers running on your system. You should judge your resources appropriately and not put 20 containers on a system that can barely run one. This is more so intended for those with 20+ core servers that are wasted when idle.
